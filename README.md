# occlude
Collisional N-body OpenCL Code using linear octrees. This is a port of the REBOUND code (https://github.com/hannorein/rebound)  to OpenCL for running on GPUs. We use a linear octree instead of the tree data structure in REBOUND. See the file Occlude.pdf for an in-depth overview of the code. This was completed for a summer project in graduate school, it was supposed result in a scientific publication, but I never got time to finish the paper.
